### Project Overview 
This is a Power BI project on a hospital dataset, Massachusetts General Hospital.
The objective was to analyze key hospital performance indicators such as the total number of patient visits, procedures and claims sliced by date.
The second was to assess patient distribution in-relation to insurance subscription, encounter class, gender, and state.

### Data Sources 
The data was divided into five dimension tables and one fact table as follows:
- Procedures
- Payers
- Patients
- Organizations
- Encounters 
- Date 

### Tool 
- Power BI 

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial stages of data cleaning and preparation, the following tasks were performed:
- Data loading and inspection in Power Query
- Handling missing values 
- Data transformation 
- Data modeling during which a star schema was created.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
These questions were explored in detail:
1. What are the average patient visits?
2. What is the most common encounter class?
3. What is the patient distribution by state, gender, and race?
4. What is the total amount of claims by sliced by date?

### Data Analysis Results
The hospital had a total of twenty-eight thousand patient visits, $102M claims, and forty-eight thousand procedures.
53.5% of the patients were female while 46.5% were male, with an overall average age of 73 years.
The most common encounter class was ambulatory patients, while the least common was inpatients.
The highest claims were from cash-paying patients ($49M).
